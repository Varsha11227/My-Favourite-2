            Kakashi is my favourite character from Naruto. He is one of Konoha's most talented ninja; regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi teaches the importance of teamwork, a lesson he received, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage.

            I like his attidute towards everything and how he handles his situations. He always keeps himself front of his comrades. He protects his people with all his life. One of his famous dialogues is "Those who break rules are scums. But those who abondone their friends are worse than scums."

       <h4> Kakashi Hatake is an ASPIRING character because heâ€™s able to come out from all the terrible tragedies in his life as a passionate and kind person. Anyone who went through what he went through would have gone evil or at least jaded but not him. Kakashi took the tragedies in his life not as failures but as lessons to which he vows to never repeat. Such is the nature of life. For the measure of your growth as a person is not determined by your age but by learning from your mistakes.</h4>
