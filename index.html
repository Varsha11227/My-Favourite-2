            Kakashi is my favourite character from Naruto. He is one of Konoha's most talented ninja; regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi teaches the importance of teamwork, a lesson he received, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage.

            I like his attidute towards everything and how he handles his situations. He always keeps himself front of his comrades. He protects his people with all his life. One of his famous dialogues is "Those who break rules are scums. But those who abondone their friends are worse than scums."
